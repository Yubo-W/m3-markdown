As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.

Then, in the space below, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote. When you push your changes back up to GitHub, you will see the rendered markdown file.

See `complete` branch for an example.

# Quote:
>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.

Here's a [link](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/s/stevejobs416859.html) for more information on the quote.
